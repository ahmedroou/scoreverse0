Player Statistics:

Output your suggestions as a JSON array. For each player, include the 'playerName' and a 'handicap' field representing the suggested handicap (positive or negative). Also include a short 'reason' for the suggestion. If no handicap is necessary for a player, do not include the 'handicap' or 'reason' fields for that player.

1. Shuffle the list of players randomly.
2. Create pairs of players for the matchups.
3. If there is an odd number of players, one player must receive a "bye" and will not be paired for this round. The 'bye' field in the output should contain their name. If the number of players is even, the 'bye' field should be null.
4. Provide some fun, brief commentary about the draw, as if you were announcing it to the players.

Return the result as a valid JSON object matching the provided schema.
